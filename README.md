# Trajectory-Tracking-Control-of-AGVs-using-NMPC
In this m-file, a NMPC framework is used to achieve position tracking control problem of an autonomous ground vehicle. 
You may define your own trajectories in "Trajectory Definition" and adjust some parameters in "Constraint Definition" to fit different constraints.
The "VehicleDynamic" function is used to described kinametics of the ground vehicle, which can also be changed if needed.
